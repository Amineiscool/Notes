The Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) states that a class should have only one responsibility or reason to change.
Each class should focus on doing one thing well, enhancing cohesion and reducing coupling.
Benefits of following SRP include improved code organization, easier understanding and navigation, and increased maintainability.
By adhering to SRP, classes become more modular, reusable, and testable.
SRP promotes separation of concerns and helps avoid code entanglement and excessive dependencies.
If a class has multiple responsibilities, changes in one area may inadvertently affect other areas, leading to fragile and tightly coupled code.
Applying SRP often involves extracting and delegating responsibilities to other classes or creating new classes that handle specific tasks.
SRP can be achieved by identifying clear responsibilities for each class and ensuring that each class has a single well-defined purpose.
SRP complements other SOLID principles such as the Open/Closed Principle (OCP) and the Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP).
SRP is not limited to individual classes; it can also be applied to methods, modules, and larger architectural components.

The Open/Closed Principle (OCP) states that software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification.
It emphasizes that the behavior of a system can be extended without modifying its existing code.
OCP promotes the idea of using abstraction and interfaces to enable adding new functionality without modifying existing code.
By following OCP, software becomes more robust, maintainable, and easily adaptable to changes.
OCP encourages the use of inheritance, polymorphism, and dependency inversion to achieve extensibility.
Rather than modifying existing classes, new classes are created that implement the desired behavior through interfaces or base classes.
OCP encourages the use of design patterns such as the Strategy Pattern or the Template Method Pattern to enable extension and customization.


The Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) states that objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without altering the correctness of the program.
Subtypes must adhere to the behavioral contracts established by their base types.
Subtypes should fulfill the same postconditions (promised outcomes) as their base types.
Subtypes must not impose stronger preconditions (required inputs) than their base types.
Clients of a class should be able to use objects of any subclass without knowing the specific subclass type.
Violating LSP can lead to unexpected behavior, incorrect results, or runtime errors in the program.
In Java, LSP can be achieved by following the "is-a" relationship, using proper method overriding, and avoiding changing the behavior of overridden methods.
LSP promotes code reusability, modularity, and extensibility by allowing new subclasses to be added seamlessly.
LSP is closely related to the Open/Closed Principle (OCP), as it ensures that classes can be extended without modifying the existing code.
Design patterns such as the Template Method Pattern and the Strategy Pattern can help adhere to LSP by providing a consistent interface for derived classes.
